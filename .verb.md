## Usage

This just returns an object of properties and filepaths to various tests. For now, tests are oriented around categorized by [base][] application

```js
var argv = require('yargs-parser')(process.argv.slice(2));
var runner = require('base-test-runner')(argv);
var suite = require('base-test-suite');

/**
 * Run the tests in `base-test-suite`
 */

runner.on('file', function(file) {
  require(file.path)(require('templates'));
});

runner.addFiles(suite.test.templates);
```

## About

This test suite includes unit tests for [base][], applications built on base, such as [assemble][], [generate][], [verb][] and [templates][], and plugins for these projects.

These projects share a plugin system and conventions, it's only natural that they share a test suite. Going forward, the plan is to test all changes against this test suite before publishing, we encourage plugin authors to do the same.
