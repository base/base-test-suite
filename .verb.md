## Usage

This just returns an object of properties, with filepaths grouped around categories of tests (for now the tests are grouped by [application](#about). 

```js
var argv = require('yargs-parser')(process.argv.slice(2));
var runner = require('base-test-runner')(argv);
var suite = require('base-test-suite');

runner.on('file', function(file) {
  // files return a function that expect a constructor 
  // to be passed as the only argument
  require(file.path)(require('templates'));
});

// run the `templates` test suite
runner.addFiles(suite.test.templates);
```

To see the properties and paths available, just do `console.log(suite)`.

## About

This test suite includes unit tests for [base][], applications built on base, such as [assemble][], [generate][], [verb][] and [templates][], and plugins for these projects.

These projects share a plugin system and conventions, it's only natural that they share a test suite. Going forward, the plan is to test all changes against this test suite before publishing, we encourage plugin authors to do the same.
